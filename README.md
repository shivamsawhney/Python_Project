# Python_Project
The Project is based on the use of of Multimonitor in Python.I have used the following Libraries of python
1.Pympress-Pympress is a little PDF reader written in Python using Poppler for PDF rendering and GTK+ for the GUI.
2.Pylink-Pylink offers a universal communication interface using File-Like API.
3.Pycharm-PyCharm provides special view modes:
-Toggling the presentation mode
-Toggling the full screen mode
 -Toggling the viewing modes in the Switch pop-up list
Install pycharm in Linux
apt-get install python3 python3-pip libgtk-3-0 libpoppler-glib8 libcairo2 python3-gi python3-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-poppler-0.18
Install pycharm On Windows
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo mingw-w64-x86_64-poppler mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-vlc python3-pip mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-pip mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-cairo
i have used pympress library as it is designed to be a dual-screen reader used for presentations and public talks, with two displays: the Content window for a projector, and the Presenter window for your laptop. 
It is portable and has been tested on various Mac, Windows and Linux systems.
